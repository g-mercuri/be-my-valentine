# 💖 Be My Valentine

A romantic, interactive Valentine's Day webpage with a playful "Yes/No" question where the "No" button keeps moving away!

## Features

- Beautiful gradient background
- Animated hearts
- Interactive buttons with playful behavior
- The "No" button runs away from your cursor
- Sweet celebration when "Yes" is clicked
- Fully responsive design

## Demo

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser to see the magic happen!

## How It Works

When you hover over the "No" button, it cleverly moves to a random position on the screen, making it nearly impossible to decline! The "Yes" button grows larger with each attempt, encouraging the right answer. 😊

## Perfect For

- Valentine's Day proposals
- Romantic gestures
- Fun interactive greetings
- Showing someone special how much you care
